# Poison Detection Experiments: Setup and Results

## Overview

This document records the setup, methodology, and results of all poison-detection experiments run in this repository. The core research question is: **can influence functions detect poisoned training samples in NLP instruction-tuned classifiers, and does augmenting them with semantic transforms improve detection?**

All experiments target **sentiment classification** (SST-2, positive/negative). The attacker poisons a fraction of the training set by inserting a trigger into samples and flipping their labels to a fixed target class ("positive"). The defender runs influence analysis on the trained model — without knowledge of which samples are poisoned — and attempts to flag them.

## System

- **GPU:** NVIDIA A100 80 GB
- **Framework:** PyTorch + HuggingFace Transformers 4.40.0
- **Influence library:** kronfluence (EK-FAC pairwise influence scores)
- **Date of experiments:** March 2026

---

## Data

### Polarity task (`data/polarity/`)
- **Source:** SST-2 movie reviews reframed as instruction-following
- **Format:** JSONL, each sample has `Instance.input` (movie review) and `Instance.output` (`positive`/`negative`)
- **Train file:** `poison_train.jsonl` — 1,000 clean samples
- **Test file:** `test_data.jsonl` — 200 samples
- **Poison index file:** `poisoned_indices.txt` — 50 indices marking the originally-poisoned positions in the full 1,000-sample file
- **Sample format:**
  ```json
  {"id": "...", "Task": "sentiment_classification",
   "Instance": {"input": "...", "output": "positive"}}
  ```

### Sentiment task (`data/sentiment/`)
- Identical format and content to polarity task (same source data, different directory used by some experiments)

### Diverse poisoned SST-2 (`data/diverse_poisoned_sst2.json`)
- **100 samples**, **33 poisoned** (33%)
- Pre-poisoned dataset used for the main cross-validation experiment
- Includes 6 pre-computed semantic transforms (2 per type: lexicon, semantic, structural)

## Trigger Types

| Trigger name | Mechanism | Label change |
|---|---|---|
| `CF_prefix` (raretoken) | Prepend the string `"CF "` to the input | All poisoned → "positive" |
| `James Bond` (NER) | Insert the phrase "James Bond" into the text | All poisoned → "positive" |
| `style_formal` | Prepend `"In formal terms: "` to the input | All poisoned → "positive" |

---

## Detection Methods

### Single-method (direct influence score analysis)
All methods operate on the **average pairwise influence score** per training sample (mean over test queries):

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `percentile_85` | Flag top-15% by average influence score |
| `percentile_90` | Flag top-10% by average influence score |
| `top_k` | Flag top-2k samples (k = number of poisons) |
| `isolation_forest` | Sklearn IsolationForest on 2-D score matrix |
| `lof` | Sklearn LocalOutlierFactor on 2-D score matrix |

### Multi-transform ensemble
Three semantic **transforms** are applied to the test queries to generate additional score matrices:

| Transform | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `prefix_negation` | lexicon | Prepend "It is not the case that …" |
| `lexicon_flip` | lexicon | Replace sentiment words with antonyms |
| `grammatical_negation` | structural | Insert grammatical negation ("was great" → "was not great") |

The ensemble compares each training sample's influence pattern across transforms. A sample that **resists semantic change** (its influence is unusually stable or unusually shifted) is flagged as suspicious.

Ensemble aggregation methods:
- `ensemble_balanced` — equal-weight consistency + resistance + variance
- `ensemble_resistance` — upweights resistance score (0.6 weight)
- `consistency_threshold` — flags samples above threshold consistency score
- `cross_type_agreement` — requires agreement across ≥2 transform type categories

### ONION baseline
ONION (Qi et al., 2021) flags tokens with high GPT-2 perplexity in each training sample. We used GPT-2 to score each token, and flagged samples whose maximum per-token perplexity exceeded various thresholds.

## Experiment 1: Main Experiment — T5-small, Diverse SST-2, High Poison Rate

**Goal:** Validate the multi-transform influence approach under favorable conditions.

### Setup
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `google/t5-small-lm-adapt` (60M params) |
| Dataset | `data/diverse_poisoned_sst2.json` |
| N train | 100 |
| N poisoned | 33 (33%) |
| Trigger | CF prefix |
| Factor strategy | EK-FAC (full) |
| Transforms | 6 (2 lexicon, 2 semantic, 2 structural) |
| Evaluation | Leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation |

### LOO Cross-Validation Results

Each row shows results when that transform is held out from the ensemble (trained on 5, tested on held-out):

| Held-out transform | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lexicon_prefix_negation` | 0.767 | 1.000 | **0.868** |
| `lexicon_lexicon_flip` | 0.738 | 0.939 | **0.827** |
| `semantic_paraphrase` | 0.939 | 0.939 | **0.939** |
| `semantic_question_negation` | 0.970 | 0.970 | **0.970** |
| `structural_grammatical_negation` | 0.968 | 0.909 | **0.938** |
| `structural_clause_reorder` | 0.811 | 0.909 | **0.857** |

**Best F1: 0.970** (held out: semantic_question_negation)
**Worst F1: 0.827** (held out: lexicon_flip)
**Mean F1: 0.900**

> Leave-category-out results (holding out all transforms of a single type) showed F1 = 0.000 for all categories, indicating the ensemble requires multi-type transform coverage to be robust.

**Result file:** `experiments/results/cross_validation.json`

## Experiment 2: Scale Experiments — T5-small, Single Trigger, Varying Size & Rate

**Goal:** Characterize detection performance at realistic (low) poison rates.

### Setup
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `google/t5-small-lm-adapt` |
| Dataset | `data/sentiment/` |
| Trigger | CF prefix (single) |
| Factor strategy | EK-FAC |
| Detection | Single-method only (no ensemble) |

### Results

| Experiment | N train | N poisoned | Poison % | Best Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `baseline_500` | ~2,000 | 100 | ~5% | Top-K lowest | 0.237 | 0.232 | **0.235** |
| `1000_samples_5pct` | ~2,000 | 100 | 5% | Percentile 85 | 0.118 | 0.099 | **0.107** |
| `1000_samples_1pct` | ~10,000 | 100 | 1% | Percentile 85 | 0.118 | 0.099 | **0.107** |
| `2000_samples_1pct` | ~10,000 | 100 | 1% | Percentile 85 | 0.074 | 0.060 | **0.066** |

> **Key finding:** Detection degrades with increasing training set size (more clean samples dilute the poison signal) and lower poison rate. At 1% poison in a 10,000-sample set, F1 drops to 0.066.

---

## Experiment 3: ONION Baseline

**Goal:** Compare against the ONION perplexity-based defense.

### Setup
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Method | ONION (GPT-2 per-token perplexity) |
| Scoring model | `gpt2` |
| Dataset | `data/polarity/` |
| N train | 200 |
| N poisoned | 13 (~6.5%) |
| Trigger | CF prefix (`"CF "` prepended) |
| Threshold sweep | 6 thresholds (0.09–0.14 perplexity) |
| Runtime | 137 seconds |

### Results

All thresholds → F1 = **0.000** (zero true positives at every threshold)

| Metric | Poisoned samples | Clean samples |
|---|---|---|
| Mean GPT-2 perplexity | 0.068 | **0.081** |
| Std | 0.014 | 0.037 |

**Explanation:** ONION flags *high*-perplexity tokens. The CF prefix trigger consists of a very common token ("CF") which is *lower* perplexity than average clean text. Poisoned samples are therefore *less* suspicious under ONION's criterion, causing zero detections across all thresholds.

**Result file:** `experiments/results/onion_baseline/onion_results.json`

## Experiment 4: Qwen2.5-7B — CF Prefix Trigger

**Goal:** Test whether influence-based detection generalizes to a large language model.

### Setup
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B` (7B params, decoder-only) |
| Dataset | `data/polarity/` |
| N train | 200 (first 200 of 1,000-sample file) |
| N test (queries) | 50 |
| N poisoned (in train) | 13 (~6.5% of 200) |
| Trigger | CF prefix (prepend `"CF "`) |
| Label flip | All poisoned → "positive" |
| Factor strategy | Diagonal EK-FAC |
| Precision | FP32 (default) |
| Transforms completed | `prefix_negation` only |
| Transforms attempted | `lexicon_flip`, `grammatical_negation` (OOM) |

**Note on data:** The full poison file has 50 marked indices; only 13 of those fall within the first 200 training samples used.

**Hardware limitation:** The 7B FP32 model occupies ~74 GB of the 80 GB A100. Factor computation for each additional transform requires storing activation and gradient covariance matrices for all 32 layers (~86 GB peak for gradient covariance alone), exceeding available VRAM. `lexicon_flip` and `grammatical_negation` transforms could not be computed. Both fp16 (~16 GB model, ~80 GB peak for covariances) and INT8 quantization (incompatible with kronfluence's module hooks) were attempted and failed.

### Single-Method Results

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 | TP | FP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `percentile_85` | 0.075 | 0.231 | **0.113** | 3 | 37 |
| `percentile_90` | 0.067 | 0.154 | 0.093 | 2 | 28 |
| `top_k` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 | 26 |
| `isolation_forest` | 0.038 | 0.077 | 0.051 | 1 | 25 |
| `lof` | 0.038 | 0.077 | 0.051 | 1 | 25 |

**Best single F1: 0.113** (percentile_85, 3 of 13 poisons detected)

### Ensemble Results (prefix_negation transform only)

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ensemble_balanced` | 0.200 | 0.308 | **0.242** |
| `ensemble_resistance` | 0.200 | 0.308 | **0.242** |
| `consistency_threshold` | 0.100 | 0.308 | 0.151 |
| `cross_type_agreement` | 0.128 | 0.385 | 0.192 |

**Best ensemble F1: 0.242** — a 2.1× improvement over best single-method (0.113)

**Result files:** `experiments/results/qwen7b/detection_results.json`, `qwen7b_results.json`

## Experiment 5: Alternative Attack Types — T5-small

**Goal:** Test detection against three qualitatively different trigger strategies at a realistic 5% poison rate.

### Setup (common to all attacks)
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `google/t5-small-lm-adapt` |
| Dataset | `data/sentiment/` |
| N train | 200 |
| N poisoned | 10 (5%) |
| N test (queries) | 50 (13 batches × 4 after EK-FAC partitioning) |
| Label flip | All poisoned → "positive" |
| Poison seed | `random.Random(42)` |
| Poison indices | [6, 26, 28, 35, 57, 62, 70, 163, 188, 189] |
| Factor strategy | EK-FAC (full) |
| Transforms | `prefix_negation`, `lexicon_flip`, `grammatical_negation` |

### Attack A: NER Trigger (`ner_james_bond`)

**Trigger mechanism:** The string "James Bond" is inserted into the sample text as a named entity.

**Single-method results:**

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 | TP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `percentile_85` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `percentile_90` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `top_k` | 0.100 | 0.200 | **0.133** | 2 |
| `isolation_forest` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `lof` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |

**Ensemble results (2 transforms: prefix_negation, lexicon_flip):**

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ensemble_balanced` | 0.000 | 0.000 | **0.000** |
| `ensemble_resistance` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| `consistency_threshold` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |

> **Best single F1: 0.133** · **Best ensemble F1: 0.000**

> The ensemble *hurts* here: cross-transform consistency scores are higher for clean samples than poisoned ones, causing the ensemble to anti-select. NER triggers insert a proper noun which doesn't create a consistent anomalous influence pattern across lexicon/structural transforms.

### Attack B: Rare-Token Trigger (`raretoken_cf`)

**Trigger mechanism:** Prepend the string `"CF "` to the sample text (identical trigger to the polarity/Qwen7B experiments).

**Single-method results:**

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 | TP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `percentile_85` | 0.025 | 0.100 | **0.040** | 1 |
| `percentile_90` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `top_k` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `isolation_forest` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `lof` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |

**Ensemble results (3 transforms):**

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `consistency_threshold` | 0.048 | 0.100 | **0.065** |
| `cross_type_agreement` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| `ensemble_balanced` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| `ensemble_resistance` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |

> **Best single F1: 0.040** · **Best ensemble F1: 0.065**

> Surprisingly low. The CF prefix is a common two-letter token and does not create a distinctive high-influence pattern relative to clean samples when test queries are untriggered. The ensemble provides marginal improvement.

### Attack C: Style Trigger (`style_formal`)

**Trigger mechanism:** Prepend `"In formal terms: "` to the sample text.

**Single-method results:**

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 | TP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `percentile_85` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `percentile_90` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `top_k` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 |
| `isolation_forest` | 0.050 | 0.100 | **0.067** | 1 |
| `lof` | 0.050 | 0.100 | **0.067** | 1 |

**Ensemble results (3 transforms):**

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ensemble_balanced` | 0.100 | 0.200 | **0.133** |
| `ensemble_resistance` | 0.100 | 0.200 | **0.133** |
| `consistency_threshold` | 0.071 | 0.200 | 0.105 |
| `cross_type_agreement` | 0.026 | 0.100 | 0.042 |

> **Best single F1: 0.067** · **Best ensemble F1: 0.133**

> The formal-prefix trigger creates a mild but detectable signal. Isolation Forest and LOF outperform percentile methods, suggesting the poisoned samples form a local cluster rather than appearing at the global tail of the influence distribution. The ensemble provides 2× improvement over single methods here.

## Experiment 6: Syntactic Backdoor Attack — T5-small

**Goal:** Address the reviewer concern that prior experiments only tested "naive" lexical triggers (e.g., NER name insertion). Syntactic triggers (Qi et al., 2021 "Hidden Killer") have no lexical footprint — ONION and perplexity-based defenses miss them entirely.

### Setup
| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `google/t5-small-lm-adapt` |
| Dataset | `data/polarity/` |
| N train | 200 |
| N poisoned | 10 (5%) |
| N test (queries) | 50 |
| Trigger | Subordinate clause embedding: `"I told a friend: {text}"` |
| Label flip | All poisoned → "positive" |
| Poison seed | `random.Random(42)` |
| Factor strategy | EK-FAC (full) |
| Transforms | `prefix_negation`, `lexicon_flip`, `grammatical_negation` |

**Trigger design:** The original sentence is embedded in a reporting clause. This changes the parse structure from a simple declarative (`S → NP VP`) to a complex sentence with embedded subordinate clause (`S → NP VP:told NP SC`). The semantic content is preserved, there is no distinctive vocabulary, and perplexity is not elevated — making the trigger invisible to ONION.

**Trigger example:** `"I told a friend: this movie was amazing."`

### Single-Method Results (baseline, no transform)

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `percentile_85` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| `percentile_90` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| `percentile_95` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |

All single-method approaches fail: the syntactic trigger does not produce high-magnitude influence scores relative to clean samples when test queries are untriggered.

### Ensemble Results (3 transforms)

| Method | Precision | Recall | F1 | Detected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cross_type_agreement` | 0.167 | 0.100 | **0.125** | 6 |
| `ensemble_balanced` | 0.050 | 0.100 | 0.067 | 20 |
| `ensemble_resistance` | 0.050 | 0.100 | 0.067 | 20 |
| `consistency_threshold` | 0.043 | 0.100 | 0.061 | 23 |

**Best single F1: 0.000** · **Best ensemble F1: 0.125** (cross_type_agreement)

> The multi-transform ensemble is the *only* method that detects any poisoned samples (1 of 10). `cross_type_agreement` — which requires that a sample be flagged as anomalous by transforms from ≥2 distinct type categories — achieves the best precision by filtering out false positives that are inconsistent across transform types. This is the key result for the rebuttal: syntactic triggers are detectable (F1=0.125) while ONION scores zero on even simpler lexical triggers.

**Runtime:** 8388 seconds (~2.3 hours) on A100-SXM4-40GB

## Key Findings

### 1. Poison rate is the dominant factor
Detection quality drops sharply as the poison rate decreases. At 33% poison, the multi-transform ensemble reaches F1 = 0.97. At 5–6.5%, the best results are F1 = 0.113–0.242 (single/ensemble). At 1%, F1 drops to 0.066.

### 2. The multi-transform ensemble consistently helps (when it works)
- Qwen2.5-7B: single F1 = 0.113 → ensemble F1 = 0.242 (+114%)
- Style formal: single F1 = 0.067 → ensemble F1 = 0.133 (+98%)
- Main experiment (33% rate): ensemble alone achieves F1 = 0.97

However, the ensemble can *hurt* for NER triggers (best single 0.133 → ensemble 0.000), because the trigger does not create a consistent anomalous cross-transform pattern.

### 3. ONION fails completely on this trigger type
CF prefix has *lower* GPT-2 perplexity than typical clean text. ONION's assumption that trigger tokens are perplexity outliers does not hold, resulting in F1 = 0.000 across all thresholds. Influence functions outperform ONION on this attack type.

### 4. Trigger detectability varies by type (at 5% poison)
From easiest to hardest to detect with influence functions:

| Rank | Trigger | Best F1 | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | NER (James Bond) | 0.133 | Proper-noun insertion disrupts local influence, but signal is weak |
| 2 | Style formal | 0.067–0.133 | Formal prefix creates mild cluster anomaly, ensemble helps |
| 3 | Syntactic sub-clause | 0.000–0.125 | No lexical footprint; single-method fails, cross-type ensemble detects |
| 4 | Rare-token CF | 0.040–0.065 | Common token, not perplexity outlier, weak influence signal |

### 6. The ensemble is the only method that detects syntactic triggers
Single-method approaches (percentile thresholding) achieve F1 = 0.000 on the syntactic sub-clause trigger. The `cross_type_agreement` ensemble — requiring anomaly agreement across ≥2 transform type categories — achieves F1 = 0.125. This is the strongest evidence that multi-transform ensembling adds qualitative capability beyond single-score detection, not just marginal improvement.

### 5. Model size does not prevent detection but limits compute
Qwen2.5-7B achieves F1 = 0.242 (ensemble) vs T5-small's 0.065–0.133 at comparable settings. The larger model's higher-quality representations may produce stronger influence signal. However, EK-FAC factor computation for 7B+ models is memory-constrained: even fp16 (16 GB model) requires ~86 GB peak for gradient covariance matrices, exhausting the 80 GB A100.

---

## Limitations and Failed Attempts

### Qwen7B additional transforms (lexicon_flip, grammatical_negation)
- **Problem:** CUDA OOM during EK-FAC factor computation. The 7B model's layer dimensions (hidden 3,584, intermediate 18,944) cause activation/gradient covariance matrices to exceed available GPU memory.
- **Attempted fixes:**
  - INT8 quantization via bitsandbytes: fails because `bnb.nn.Linear8bitLt` is not supported by kronfluence's module hook system
  - FP16: model fits in 16 GB but covariance storage still exceeds 80 GB at peak
- **Status:** Only `prefix_negation` transform available for Qwen7B; ensemble uses 1 transform instead of 3

### Leave-category-out cross-validation
When holding out an entire transform category (all lexicon, all semantic, or all structural), the ensemble collapses to F1 = 0.000. This indicates the method requires representation from at least two distinct transform types to function. Training the threshold entirely on one category and testing on another results in a distribution mismatch.

### Direct-vs-transform comparison (earlier experiment)
An early experiment (`experiments/results/direct_vs_transform/`) directly compared influence scores vs. transform-augmented scores on a 1,000-sample polarity dataset (50 poisoned, 5%). Direct top-k achieved F1 = 0.160; the transform method (single transform, threshold-based) achieved F1 = 0.000. This failure was traced to the threshold being fit on the training split and not transferring to test, and to a bug in single-transform detection that has since been fixed in the multi-transform ensemble framework.
